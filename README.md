# push_swap

This is the 42 project, push_swap. The goal was to sort a list of unique integers using two stacks (stack_a and stack_b) using a set of seven different command options, and the challenge was to do so using as few of the commands as possible. Two programs were written, "push_swap", and "checker." The first, push_swap, takes as input a list, and generates a sequence of commands that will sort the list. This list of commands, printed to standard output, defines the steps that must be taken to sort the list. These commands can then be input into the "checker" program in order to verify that the list has been sorted.
